1.1 Basic Programming Model
---
### Basic structure of a Java program
### Primitive data types and expressions
### Statements
### Shortcut notations
### Arrays
* Aliasing
		
		int[] a = new int[N];
		...
		int[] b = a;


### Static methods
* Arguments are passed by value.
* Recursion. Three important rules of thumb:
	* The recursion has a base case.
	* Recursive calls must address subproblems that are smaller.
	* Recursive calls should not address subproblems that overlap.
* Unit testing.
	> A best practice in Java programming is to include a `main()` in every library of static methods that tests the methods in the library.

### APIs
* Your own libraries.
	> It is worthwhile to consider *every program that you write* as a library implementation, for possible reuse in the future.


### Strings
* `String` is *not* a primitive type.

### Input and output
* Redirection and piping.

### Binary Search Example
